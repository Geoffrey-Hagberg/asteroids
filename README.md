# asteroids
Asteroids project for boot.dev

TODO:
- update shot position to start offset by radius (i.e., at tip of triangle instead of center)
- add collisions between asteroids
- handle the player moving to the edge? or change to move all objects relative to player instead of moving player?
- adjust player movement to have momentum, with deceleration instead of reverse movement
