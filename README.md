# asteroids
Asteroids project for boot.dev

TODO:
- update shot position to start offset by radius (i.e., at tip of triangle instead of center)
- add collisions between asteroids
- remove forward/backward movement to match original game's fixed position with rotation only; or adjust movement to move the game field around the player and keep the player centered?
- adjust player movement to have momentum, with deceleration instead of reverse movement?
- adjust visual representation of asteroids to be more interesting than circles
- adjust collision detection to exact bounds of shapes
- add explosion animations?
- add scoring system
- add asteroids wrapping around screen instead of moving off screen
- add random events (a la the UFO in original)
- pixel-art starfield background; as score reaches certain milestones, background changes
- randomize color of asteroids within a range of browns and grays
