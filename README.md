# asteroids
Asteroids project for boot.dev

TODO:
- update shot position to start offset by radius (i.e., at tip of triangle instead of center)
- add collisions between asteroids
- remove forward/backward movement to match original game's fixed position with rotation only
- adjust player movement to have momentum, with deceleration instead of reverse movement
- adjust visual representation of asteroids to be more interesting than circles
- adjust collision detection to exact bounds of shapes
- add explosion animations?
